# Psychic-Game

This is a game that was assigned in my coding class where the computer random letter or number and you as a play have to guess what the computer came up with. As you play each round the game will record your guesses and what they were, if you guess correctly before you run out of guesses you will get a point if not it will be added to your losses.
